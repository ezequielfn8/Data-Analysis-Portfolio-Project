# Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Project

In this Project, I worked the following Python libraries:
-Pandas
-Matplotlib
-Scipy 

I worked with two databases provided by CodeCademy.com, species_info and observations, to work on National Parks Service data.

Before the analysis, I joined both table with SQLite3 (in DB Browser) to get  a third database.

To see this work, go to the Project(Enlgish) file.
